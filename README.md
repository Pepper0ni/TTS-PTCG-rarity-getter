# TTS-PTCG-rarity-getter
A tool I made to easilly get rarity data for adding packdata to my Pack simulator script. To use, simply apply the script to an object, reload the object by cut and pasting it, enter the name of the pack you want rarities for **exactly**, including capitals, then get rarities.
